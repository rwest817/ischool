Homework 2

My data source is a CSV  dataset detailing the Titanic's passengers, available from
 Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/data?train.csv.

I'm using the  command line (first time!) to load and explore the CSV file.

1) What are the types of data that are available to you?

There are string and numeric variables organized into traditional dataset format.
Each row represents a passenger on the Titanic, and each column is a set of
characteristics for that passenger. The first column, PassengerID, provides a unique
identifier, and serves as a key to link this dataset to others in Kaggle's
collection about the Titanic.

2) For data sets: how many records are in the data set?

The "wordcount" command shows that there are 891 lines in the dataset. This makes
sense: although there were more than 3000 passengers on the Titanic, I have
downloaded the training dataset, which contains only a subset of the data.

3) Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties, and why it is
interesting.

Look! There's a passenger on the Titanic with the same last name as me!

grep '"Name": "West"' titanic.csv

That's kind of cool. I wonder whether she survived...
head -n 1 titanic.csv

Column 2 gives survival information (1=survived, 0=died)

awk -F "," '{print $2 }' titanic.csv


4) What are 3 questions you could answer using your data?

a) Were females and children disproportionately likely to obtain a place on a
lifeboat?

b) Were adults males  who had children (assuming same last name identifies  families)
more likely to survive than adult males without children?

c) What was the probability of survival, conditional upon passenger class (1st,
2nd, 3rd; available from the variable Pclass). Were privileged adults (i.e.,
those in 1st class) more likely to survive than poor children (3rd class)? Were
privileged men more likely to survive than poor women?

# view the first 5 lines:
head -n 5 titanic.csv

# how many characters, words, and lines in the file?
wc titanic.csv

# is there anyone with my last name on the Titanic?
